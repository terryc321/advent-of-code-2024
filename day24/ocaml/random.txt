(* if want to try to solve wiring puzzle
   ocaml types 0 1 okay
   if want to say has no useful value then option type None or Some n

   if all z values are determined
   [z1 , z2
   List.filter (fun x -> match (!x) with | Some _ -> true | _ -> false) [x01; x02; x03];;
   List.filter (fun x -> match (!x) with | Some _ -> true | _ -> false) [z00 ; z01; z02; z03];;

   then convert to binary value

(* (\* variable is either known or unknown at the moment *\) *)
(* let x01 = ref (Some 0);; *)
(* let x02 = ref (Some 1);; *)
(* let x03 = ref None;; *)


(* !x01 ;; *)
(* all variables get initial setting None *)
(* x01 := None ;; *)
(* !x01 ;; *)


(*
if either x or y not determined yet , say nothing
if both determined then say the result
think about single assignment

   iand x01 x02 x03 ;;  if x01 and x02 have Some value , then x03 will also then get a value
   simply keep looping until all have values
